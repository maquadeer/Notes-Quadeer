## `Title:` Social Networking Site - UML-based Project Overview

Our project focuses on developing a feature-rich Social Networking Site with extensive functionalities for both admin and regular users. Admins can manage Videos, Users, and Posts, while users engage in activities such as searching, generating reports, and interacting with interconnected entities like Videos, Users, and Posts.

**Key Features:**
- **`Admin Capabilities:`** Search, view, add, update, and delete Videos; manage Users.
- **`User Functionalities`:** Search, generate reports on Social Network activities, Photos, and Posts.
- **`Secure Login:`** Verification required for admin and user access to site features.

**UML Diagrams Used:**
1. **`Class Diagram:`** Illustrates structure with main classes - *Users, Friends, Posts, Shares, Photos, Videos.*
2. **`Login Activity Diagram:`** Visualizes the flow of the login process, emphasizing *secure access to pages post-login.*
3. **`Login Sequence Diagram:`** Details the sequence of events during the *login* process, highlighting secure access to specific pages.
4. **`Use Case Diagram:`** Represents interactions among actors (Super Admin, System User, Users) for various use cases.

**Flexibility:** Other types of UML diagrams, such as Sequence Diagrams, State Machine Diagrams, or Component Diagrams, may be incorporated as needed, ensuring adaptability to project requirements and enhancing the overall system design.
