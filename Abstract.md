# `Title`: Airlines Management System - UML-based Project Overview

Our project revolves around the creation of a comprehensive Airlines Management System, incorporating advanced functionalities for effective administration and seamless user experiences. Admins have the capability to manage flights, passengers, and reservations, while users can perform tasks like booking flights, checking schedules, and managing their reservations.

**Key Features:**

- **`Admin Capabilities:`** Manage flights, passengers, reservations; update schedules.
- **`User Functionalities`:** Book flights, check schedules, manage reservations.

**UML Diagrams Used:**

1. **`Class Diagram:`** Illustrates the system structure with classes like Flights, Passengers, Reservations, Users, and more.
2. **`Activity Diagram:`** Represents the workflow of processes such as flight booking and reservation management.
3. **`Sequence Diagram:`** Details the sequence of interactions between objects during key processes like flight booking.
4. **`Use Case Diagram:`** Identifies interactions among actors (Admin, User) for different use cases.

**`Flexibility`:** The project design allows for the inclusion of additional UML diagrams like State Machine Diagrams, Component Diagrams, or Deployment Diagrams based on evolving project needs.
